## Description

I decided to do this project to start a base website for my daughters future asperations of becoming a YouTube content creator. She really enjoys making videos, being silly on camera, and of course watching others videos. My hope is that in time I will have learned the editing and coding skill required to make this a working website and her a booming YouTube creator.

On the technical side I have included a form for capturing data on possible future subscribers, a javascript carousel to display a few images of her favorite things, a link to her first video and a short about me, and a giant hero image of her as the main star of the page. I used FlexBox as the main basis for responsiveness as well as a few media queries to help make it fully funtional. There is three Javascript elements total including the image carousel and the top of page function.

## Custom CSS Classes

1. hero - This CSS class gives the h1 and h2 titles a home as well as puts the hero image in place.

2. flex-container - This CSS class is the container for the three boxes I use to control the main content of the page.

3. box1,box2,box3 - These classes each contain a different subset of content for the page. They are setup in a flexbox to control the responsiveness.

4. form - This is used to allow me to setup the form. It includes a name, email, phone number, option select field, and a general message section.

## Custom JavaScript Functions

1. carousel-slide - This controls the images and allows for them to be cycled through one at a time. I also added a transition so that when the carousel meets the last image in the set it will cycle back to the first image again. This function also works in reverse.

2. topfunction - This just takes the page back to the top when a user is at the bottom of the page and doesn't feel like scrolling.

3. hideBtn - This shows the buttons to change the picture inside the carousel div when you hover over the div.
